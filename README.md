# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game-using-OpenCV-and-Hand-Tracking
This project is a Rock-Paper-Scissors game using OpenCV and hand tracking. Players use a webcam to show hand gestures, with keyboard controls to start (`s`), pause (`p`), and quit (`q`). Scores for both player and computer are displayed in real-time.
